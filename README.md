My Newsletter Email Collector.

Most of the tech news that I read is from email newsletters. Previously, these emails just piled up in my inbox as I forgot to read them on a regular basis. Therefore, I decided to organize my reading a bit and created this app. Basically, what it does is fetch predetermined newsletter emails from my Gmail, save them on my local storage, and suggests one of them to read everyday. Currently it is run as a daemon on my Mac.
